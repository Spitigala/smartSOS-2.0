## About SmartSOS

SmartSOS is a platform that connects non-profit organizations and donors to get critical supplies to where they are needed. We give organizations the flexibility to specify the items they need and adjust to fluctuating needs, while giving donors instant gratification by allowing them to choose which items they donate. The result is better resource allocation and transparency between donors and organizations.
